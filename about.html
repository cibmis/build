                great employees. The three sides of the triangle represent our core values of Service, Solutions and
                Integrity. The three sets of lines coming in then out of the circle represent the relationship with our
                Clients, Communities and Shareholders. This all comes together to form the CIBM fingerprint which
                is unique and secure: incorporating our values, mission and culture.</p>
              <h2>History of CIBM Bank</h2>
              <p>In 1985, a small group of investors acquired Sidney Bancorp, Inc., and its bank subsidiary, Sidney Community Bank, in Sidney, Illinois. Through a series of transactions and consolidations, that bank eventually became Central Illinois Bank and acquired Arrowsmith State Bank in 1991. The former Arrowsmith State Bank charter was established in 1920 and is the Illinois commercial bank charter that CIBM Bank operates under today.</p>
              <p>Over the next 25 years, CIBM went through a series of expansion activities that led to our footprint today with branch offices in Illinois (Champaign, Urbana, Danville, Monticello, Bloomington, Peoria and Wheaton); Indiana (Indianapolis), and Wisconsin (Brookfield and Elm Grove). In 2013, we acquired the assets of Avenue Mortgage Corp., in Naperville, Illinois, and have since expanded our offering of residential mortgage services with mortgage professionals in most of our branch offices as well as satellite offices in Naperville, Arlington Heights, and Decatur, Illinois; Indianapolis, Indiana; East Lansing, Michigan; and Sheboygan, Wisconsin. In 2016, we formed our Government Guaranteed Lending Division, which services many states in the Midwest and Southeast.</p>
              <p>Prior to 2019, we utilized different brand names across our markets: Central Illinois Bank (Central Illinois); Marine Bank (Milwaukee and Indianapolis); Avenue Bank (Wheaton, Illinois); and Avenue Mortgage (at all mortgage offices). In 2019, we unified our brands under our legal name of CIBM Bank with the new logo and icon you see today.</p>
