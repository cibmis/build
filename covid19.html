        <p>Many additional requests can be serviced over the phone – and we are happy to do so. You can reach us at (877)925-3030 or by calling your local branch location.  </p>
        <h5>Branch Locations and Internal Efforts</h5>
        <p>Effective 3/18/20, all branch locations will be accessible by drive-up only. The lobby closure will continue until it is safe for our customers and employees.  We will continue to comply with the “shelter in place” directives issued by the states we operate in and will reopen lobbies when it is safe to do so. This is an effort to promote social distancing and prioritize the health and well-being of our communities. All banking activity (with the exception of accessing safe deposit boxes) can be serviced via the drive-up window.</p>
        <p>When visiting a drive-up, for faster service and smoother operation, please utilize Lane 1 to conduct personal banking activity and non-customer check cashing. Please conduct teller transactions in all other lanes.</p>
        <p>In order to ensure you do not experience a disruption in service, we are happy to service customers who need additional assistance in the lobby by appointment only. Please contact your branch location to schedule. We practice clean environment procedures, have increased sanitation, and will conduct appointments one relationship at a time while practicing safe distancing.</p>
        <p>All staff members have been advised to remain at home if they are not feeling well.</p>
        <h5>Protect yourself from scams</h5>
        <p>Fraudsters are taking advantage of the global health situation and uneasiness of the general public.  New scams are coming to light each day and old ones are evolving.  A variety of tactics are being utilized: phone calls, websites, text messages, emails, social media posts, and more.  These tactics involve spoofing caller IDs and email addresses to appear to be legitimate organizations among other scams. </p>
        <p>Please know that we will NEVER ask for confidential information -- such as your name, password, PIN or other account information -- if we reach out to you.  You should never share this information. Please refer to our <a href="fraudprevention.html">Fraud Prevention</a> page for more information. </p>
