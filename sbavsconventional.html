      <p>Whether your company is looking to purchase a building, buy new equipment, or need working capital, most companies will look to their bank for financing options.  But what options are available?  There is traditional commercial lending, in which the company will usually put 20% - 25% down and the bank will finance the remaining cost for a term of 5 – 7 years for equipment, or 15 years for real estate.  But what happens if your company doesn’t have 25% cash to put into the project?  That’s where SBA lending can help!</p>
      <p>SBA loans are different than traditional commercial loans because of their flexibility in cash injection, terms and collateral requirements.  Here are the general differences, but keep in mind that each loan request is evaluated on its own merit:</p>
      <h6>SBA Loans</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>10% cash injection usually required</li>				
        <li>Longer Terms available, such as 25 years for the purchase of real estate</li>		
        <li>Collateral shortfall is okay, as long as all available collateral is taken</li>
        <li>Term and amortization match, meaning you never have to refinance and pay additional fees</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>Commercial Loans</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>20% - 25% cash injection is usually required, depending on the project</li>
        <li>Terms will typically be shorter, with real estate financed at 15-25 years, depending on the type of real estate and/or age of the building</li>
        <li>Loans must be fully collateralized</li>
        <li>Usually, commercial loans will have a shorter term, with a longer amortization – meaning you will need to renew / refinance the loan</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Utilizing SBA lending for your business needs can help save cash!  With a lower down payment, you can retain more money in your company for every day cash flow needs.  Longer term amortizations will result in lower payments, which will also help you save money.</p>
      <p>If your company is ready for financing, consider the advantages of SBA lending to meet those needs</p>
