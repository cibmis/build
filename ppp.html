      <p>On April 2, 2020 the Small Business Administration released final details regarding the Paycheck Protection Program application process.  The release, titled the interim final rule can be found below.</p>
      <p>The Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) authorizes up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses to pay their employees during the COVID-19 crisis. <b>All loan terms will be the same for everyone.</b> </p>
      <p><b>Who can apply?</b> All businesses – including nonprofits, veterans organizations, Tribal business concerns, sole proprietorships, self-employed individuals, and independent contractors – with 500 or fewer employees can apply. Businesses in certain industries can have more than 500 employees if they meet applicable SBA employee-based size standards for those industries.</p>
      <p>For this program, the SBA’s affiliation standards are waived for small businesses (1) in the hotel and food services industries; or (2) that are franchises in the SBA’s Franchise Directory; or (3) that receive financial assistance from small business investment companies licensed by the SBA.
