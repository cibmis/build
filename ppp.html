      <p>On December 27, 2020, the <i>Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (Economic Aid Act)</i>, was signed into law which will allow for Second Draw Paycheck Protection Program loans to eligible borrowers. On January 8, 2021, the Small Business Administration (SBA) released final details regarding the Paycheck Protection Program application process. The release, titled the interim final rule can be found below.</p>
      <div class="text-center mb-3"><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001lupKMnkgef1mKxgZL9dYjhiHQWcgRvUqyuDem23oc9wFjU9huM7mJUVHVmBEYC-xg72YHhdh9QX6y_3sP7WFV9K8UvwdM2jFHAWx2E7Ra2u9DFqOJ6AEsZCZMsU45SkHJLzkh9cPC_yeavpTpbaGNyMS-RGA2msLwBdP8xttBk-_RCDqmF1prtVJcmiqJd4pW13AXY2kawVaybt9jOJFfU_HG7nrv7ktAgwZvaNGTfw=&c=wprb5knNZh7d-N-qGA1GuBBLcH8cCnITTO6YCLVR8hdgJVIjVrwLDA==&ch=KYlqprlIIscijBECQei2svH2U2C9qDjUckOMAea1Q9L5DQ_IkFrvbQ==" target="_blank">Interim Final Rule</a></div>
      <p>The Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) has been reauthorized for up to $284 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses to pay their employees during the on-going COVID-19 crisis. These funds will remain available until March 31, 2021, or until they are exhausted, whichever comes first. </p>
      <h6>Who can apply?</h6>
      <p>Please refer to the interim guidance for a complete listing of program eligibility.</p>
      <p>All businesses – including nonprofits, veteran organizations, Tribal business concerns, sole proprietorships, self-employed individuals, and independent contractors – with 300 or fewer employees can apply.</p>
      <p>For this PPP program, the SBA requires that a company must have experienced a revenue reduction of 25% or greater in 2020 relative to 2019.  This is calculated by comparing the borrower’s quarterly gross receipts for one quarter in 2020 with the borrower’s gross receipts for the corresponding quarter of 2019.  It may also be calculated using year end annual tax records for 2019 and 2020.</p>
      <p>NOTE:  this documentation of revenue reduction is also required when the borrower applies for loan forgiveness, as required under the Economic Aid Act.</p>
      <h6>What qualifies as “payroll costs?”</h6>
      <p>Payroll costs consist of compensation to employees in the form of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Salary, wages, commissions, or similar compensation.</li>
        <li>Cash tips or the equivalent (based on employer records of past tips or, in the absence of such records, a reasonable, good-faith employer estimate of such tips).</li>
        <li>Payment for vacation, parental, family, medical, or sick leave.</li>
        <li>Allowance for separation or dismissal. </li>
        <li>Payment for the provision of employee benefits consisting of group health care coverage, including insurance premiums.</li>
        <li>Employee Retirement expense.</li>
        <li>Payment of state and local taxes assessed on compensation of employees.  </li>
      </ul>
      <h6>What is expressly excluded from the definition of payroll costs?</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Any compensation of an employee whose principal place of residence is outside of the United States</li>
        <li>The compensation of an individual employee in excess of an annual salary of $100,000, prorated as necessary.</li>
        <li>Federal employment taxes imposed or withheld during the applicable period, including the employee’s and employer’s share of FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) and Railroad Retirement Act taxes, and income taxes required to be withheld from employees.  (It is interpreted that all Federal taxes, including FICA, are excluded)</li>
        <li>Qualified sick and family leave wages for which a credit is allowed under sections 7001 and 7003 of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>Documentation Required (Subject to change as the interim final rule lacks clarification on certain issues)</h6>
      <ol>
        <li>Application – linked below  (note: “number of employees” is equal to full time equivalent employees (“FTEs”)).</li>
        <li>Borrowers must submit such documentation as is necessary to establish eligibility such as payroll processor records, payroll tax filings, or Form 1099-MISC, or income and expenses from a sole proprietorship. (example - Quarterly IRS 941’s for either 2019 or 2020)</li>

      <h6>Loan Details</h6>
      <ol>
        <li>Loan Amount = 2.5x the average monthly payroll expense from 2019 or 2020 (less foreign employees or any compensation to individual employees over $100,000), OR 3.5x the average monthly payroll expense from 2019 or 2020 (less foreign employees or any compensation to individual employees over $100,000) for companies that have a NAICS Code beginning with 72</li>
        <li>The Covered Period for using the funds will be the borrowers choice and can be 8 weeks to 24 weeks</li>
        <li>After the Covered Period, the borrower can apply for loan forgiveness</li>
        <li>Interest rate: 1%.</li>
      </ol>

      </ul>
