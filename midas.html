          <h1>How It Works</h1>
          <p>CIBM Bank participates in a program with other community banks where customer deposits within the Money Investment Deposit Account Solution, in excess of the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit per account registration, are automatically allocated to other FDIC-insured accounts held at other banks in the program. This fully automated cash management account enables you to receive millions of dollars in FDIC insurance while having access to all of your cash on a daily basis.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <a name="disclosure"><p class="mt-3 small font-weight-light">Funds participating in the CIBM Bank Money Investment Deposit Account Solution are deposited into deposit accounts at participating banks, which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for up to $250,000 for each category of legal ownership, including any other balances you may hold directly or through other intermediaries, including broker-dealers. The total amount of FDIC insurance for your account depends on the number of banks in the program. If the balance in your account is greater than the FDIC insurance coverage in the program, any excess funds will not be insured. Please read the Program Terms and Conditions carefully before depositing money into the program and for other important customer disclosures and information. To assure your FDIC coverage, please regularly review banks in which your funds have been deposited, and notify your bank immediately if you do not want to allocate funds to a particular bank or banks.</p></a>
