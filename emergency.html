      <p>We all know deep down that we should have an emergency fund for that rainy day.  But how do you build one?  How do you save for it?</p>
      <p>The following are tips that could put you on the right path to creating your emergency fund:</p>
      <p><span class="font-weight-bold">1.  Figure out where you want to put your money</span><br>It is highly recommended that you do <span class="font-weight-bold"><u>NOT</u></span> put your excess money in the empty cookie jar.  So, choose an option like a <a href="permoneymarket.html">money market</a>, a <a href="cd.html">certificate of deposit</a>, or a high yield savings account like our <a href="accelsavings.html">Acceleration Savings</a> that partners with Acceleration Checking.</p>
      <p><span class="font-weight-bold">2.  Determine a goal</span><br>How much money should you put away for an emergency?  Some would say one to two month’s wages in reserve is ideal while others would say three to six months’ worth of household expenses is appropriate.   The most important thing is to begin with a target and start</p>
      <p><span class="font-weight-bold">3.  Make it automatic</span><br>The secret to successfully putting money away is to make it automatic.  This can be as easy as splitting your direct deposit to put a certain dollar amount into your emergency fund each pay period until you get to your desired goal.  A great time to consider doing this is around salary adjustment time.  That way you continue to be on the same budget you were on, but put any increase into your emergency fund.</p>
      <p>The other option is for your checking account to do an automatic transfer each month.  This is a less desirable method as you might spend too much, and the transfer may be unable to occur. </p>
      <p><span class="font-weight-bold">4.  Assess your progress</span><br>After a few weeks or a month, are you meeting your goals?  Are you getting close to your desired outcome?  If so, what do you plan on doing after your emergency fund achieves its goal?  You could put the extra money elsewhere, like for a college fund for your kids or into a retirement account.</p>
      <p><span class="font-weight-bold">5.  Only use the money for a tue emergency</span><br>This is the most important step along the way.  Utilize your emergency funds for a true emergency:  medical emergencies, acts of nature, car accidents, tax bills, home repairs, etc.  The funds should <span class="font-weight-bold"><u>NOT</u></span> be used for the non-emergencies like those Christian Louboutins that just went on sale, that new BMW calling your name, or that vacation to the Bahamas away from the snow.  If you wish to have those things, then consider opening up another account (slush fund) to put additional money into just like the emergency fund but don’t touch your emergency fund for non-emergencies.</p>
      <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Remeber this:</span> it could take you some time to build an emergency fund, and that is quite alright.  Even if it takes you months, and you can only save a few dollars at a time, you are making progress and putting yourself in a better financial position.</p>
