        <p class="text-white">Itâ€™s easy! Upon approval, funds borrowed are deposited into a <a href="https://www.cibmbank.com/bonussavings.html" class="text-white">Bonus Savings Account</a> on your behalf and held as collateral. Each month, through the term of your loan and as you make your payments, CIBM Bank will report your payment history to the credit bureaus. When the loan is paid in full, funds held as collateral in the savings account, including interest earned, are released to you!</p>
