          <h3>How a line of credit works</h3>
          <p>A business line of credit differs from a term loan, which provides a one-time lump sum of cash up front, repaid over a fixed timeframe.</p>
          <p>With a business line of credit, a borrowing limit is set based on your specific business needs.  You can draw on your line of credit and deposit funds in your CIBM business account (hyperlink) to pay for needed items and expenses.  You can keep reusing the line and repaying it as often as youâ€™d like, up to your established borrowing limit.  Monthly payments are typically interest only, but, you are allowed to repay your balance early to save on interest costs.</p>
          <p>All lines of credit are subject to CIBM Bank approval.  Specific collateral and other requirements may apply. </p>
