        <p>Financial abuse occurs when a person’s money or possessions are used without permission or in a fraudulent manner.  Doing so can take away or limit an older person’s resources, choices, and options. Indicators that this may be occurring are a sudden inability to pay bills, withdraw money, poor living conditions, or a refusal to spend money without a caregiver’s permission.</p>
        <p>Seniors from all walks of life, economic backgrounds, and educational levels are susceptible to elder abuse.  It can also lead to isolation. The best way to uncover what is happening is to spend time with them, listening to their stories. Trust is the most critical element.  Talking with your elderly friend or relative isn’t prying; it’s showing you care. Providing a friendly listening ear will ensure an older person is less isolated.  As you enhance your relationship and talk about their issues, you may even help open the door to a variety of services.  All it takes is a little time and a phone call.</p>
