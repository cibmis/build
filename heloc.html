        <p class="text-white text-center">So you have heard of a home equity line of credit (HELOC), but arenâ€™t sure if it make sense for you.  Here are some things to think about and three ways homeowners typically use HELOCs.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-center">The difference between the appraised value of your home and the balance of your mortgage is home equity.  You may be able to borrow a portion of that equity and use it as a revolving line of credit secured by your home.  This is a home equity line of credit.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="row text-center text-primary my-3">
        <p>When you choose a home equity line of credit you may borrow and repay up to the loan limit as often as you would like throughout the term of the loan, typically making minimum interest only monthly payments.  At the end of the term of the loan, the balance must be repaid in full over a set period of time.  One of the biggest benefits of home equity lines of credit can be very attractive interest rates.</p>

        <p class="text-white text-center"><b>Tip: </b>Not all home improvements add value to your home.  Pay close attention to costs, personal value, and potential return on your investment.</p>
