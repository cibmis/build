      <p>We are all more reliant on online services than ever before and for each of these online sites, we have to have a password to keep our information and transactions secure.  Here are some tips on creating good passwords and how to manage them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>DO use a different password for each site.  The reuse of passwords, while it makes it easy to remember, means that if that one password is compromised that all of your accounts are compromised.</li>
        <li>DO NOT use personal information as your password.  Using birthdays, relatives names, and dates are just too easy to obtain and for hackers to guess.</li>
        <li>DO use a long password.  Most sites will have a requirement on the length of the password, but at a minimum make sure your password is at least 8 characters.</li>
        <li>DO use a mix of capital letters, numbers and symbols.</li>
        <li>DO use a pass phrase.  Using the first letter of a phrase can help make it memorable while still making it hard to crack.  For example, you might take a phrase like “Too be or not too be, that is the question” and make a password of 2Bon2btit?.  That utilizes numbers upper and lower case letters and a symbol, to create a very good password.</li>
        <li>DO consider using a password manager.  A password manager can create and remember random strong passwords that are only accessed after entering a strong master password.  Remember this is only as secure as your Master Password, so make it a strong one.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Use of a strong password makes the need to change that password as often less necessary.  The reasoning behind changing passwords often is that people choose pro password that can be guessed and compromised easily.  Use a strong password and you won’t have to change it as often.</p>
