          <h3>How a business term loan works </h3>
          <p>A CIBM term loan can help ensure that your business is able to grow on its own terms.  Term loans are a great solution to solve a variety of business needs including equipment purchases, business expansion, or debt restructuring.  </p>
          <p>A term loan provides cash to fund short or longer term business investment and capital needs.  A term loan can have a fixed or floating rate of interest, with a maturity and payment amortization set based on the expected useful life of the underlying business collateral, and/or the related cash flow of the project or business.</p>
          <p>All term loans are subject to CIBM Bank approval.  Specific collateral and other requirements may apply.</p>
