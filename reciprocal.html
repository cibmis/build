      <p>How would you like big bank safety and security but with the convenience and service levels of a community bank?  Sometimes being a smaller bank can be perceived as a problem for depositors when it comes to safety and security or for businesses and municipalities with investment policy requirements for larger deposits above $250,000 FDIC insurance limits.  That NO LONGER is that a limiting factor at CIBM Bank!  With enhanced systems and technology we are able to vastly increase your FDIC deposit insurance coverage at the bank from $250,000 to $25,000,000 or 100 TIMES standard amounts on deposits you place in a new CIBM Bank Money Investment Deposit Account Service (MIDAS) account.</p>
      <p>Something like “Wait, what?  Really, come on.” Is a typical first response, but it really is quite simple, safe, and easy – we help you get more FDIC insurance coverage and use technology to do most of the work so you don’t have to.  In summary, the deposit account has all the convenience and ease of use as any other at CIBM Bank, the extra FDIC insurance coverage happens behind the scenes.</p>
      <p>When you make your MIDAS deposit, using technology and a trustee we split the deposit into amounts of $250,000 or less and place those deposits or ‘sweep them’ into qualifying FDIC insured banks.  That same process happens every single day the funds are on deposit and you are not limited by the number of days it can happen in a month unlike a Money Market Account.  The trustee maintains the transaction records between banks and CIBM Bank maintains the confidentiality of your name and personal information – the other banks providing the additional FDIC insurance coverage will not know your name, address, tax identification number, account number or any other personal information so you can rest assured your money and your confidential information are safe.</p>
      <p>You might wonder “hmmm, but when can I get my money back from those other banks and how do I do that if I don’t know who or where they are?”  We have a very simpler answer … “instantly through your MIDAS account at CIBM Bank”.  Your full funds availability is no different than the same deposit you make in any other CIBM Bank checking or money market account.  Those balances at the other banks will be visible to you and show full availability on your MIDAS account at CIBM Bank – this is considered your lead account.  You will never need to contact or write a check off those other banks - you simply withdraw funds through your lead MIDAS account at CIBM Bank, and we retrieve the money instantly and automatically for you so no extra work is needed on your part.  You will even get a separate statement monthly summarizing how much money is at each of the other banks and you will never need to correspond with the other bank.</p>
      <p>Let’s do a final run down for CIBM Bank’s MIDAS deposit:</p>
